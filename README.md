SoFiA
=====

Introduction üç∏
--------------

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/SoFiA-Admin/SoFiA/Images/sofia_screenshot.png" width="232" height="230" alt="SoFiA screenshot" />

SoFiA, the Source Finding Application, is a new **HI source finding pipeline** 
intended to find and parametrise galaxies in HI data cubes. SoFiA can be 
launched from the command line, but it also comes with an easy-to-use 
graphical user interface that allows control parameters to be manipulated 
interactively. While the software is still under development, several 
stable versions of SoFiA have already been released and can be obtained 
from the SoFiA webpage on GitHub.

If you would like to stay informed about new stable releases of SoFiA and 
other important updates, you can sign up to the **SoFiA mailing list**. To do 
so, simply send an e-mail to `sofia-request [at] atnf.csiro.au` with the 
word `subscribe` in the e-mail body (note that the e-mail subject will be 
ignored).


Requirements üìã
--------------

The following packages and libraries will be required to install and run 
SoFiA:

* Operating system:
  * Linux or Unix (e.g. Ubuntu, Mac OS, etc.)
  * Terminal with `bash` or `tcsh` (other shells should work as well)
* Packages (Python):
  * `Python` (= 2.7; including dev package)
  * `NumPy` (‚â• 1.8)
  * `SciPy` (‚â• 0.7)
  * `Astropy` (‚â• 0.2.5)
  * `matplotlib` (‚â• 1.1; optional, needed for reliability plots)
* Packages (C/C++):
  * Compiler:
    * Preferred: `GCC` (‚â• 4.8; including `g++`)
    * Alternative: `Clang` (‚â• 3.3; Xcode version ‚â• 5.0.0 (clang-500.2.75))
  * Graphical user interface (_optional_):
    * `zlib` (‚â• 1.2.8; including dev package)
    * `Qt` (‚â• 4.7; including dev packages and `qmake`)

All of the above packages, unless marked as _optional_, must be installed 
before SoFiA can be compiled and run. It is recommended that you install them 
through your operating system‚Äôs package manager.

Installation of the GUI, and hence of `zlib` and `Qt`, is optional and can be 
disabled during installation using the `--no-gui=True` option (see below for 
installation instructions). If you want the GUI to be installed, please ensure 
that the **development packages** of zlib and the Qt library are installed as 
well.

_Just as an example, on an Ubuntu system with Qt4 the `zlib1g-dev`, 
`libqt4-dev` and `qt4-qmake` packages must be installed as well._


Installation üîß
--------------

To install SoFiA on your computer, open a terminal window and change into the 
folder where the downloaded file was saved. Then follow the steps below.

1. Unpack all files

   Download and unpack the zipped archive into a directory of your choice:

   `unzip SoFiA-[version].zip`

   or

   `tar -xzvf SoFiA-[version].tar.gz`

   where `[version]` is the downloaded version of SoFiA, e.g. 1.0. This will 
   unpack all files into a directory called `SoFiA-[version]`.

2. Enter the installation directory

   `cd SoFiA-[version]`

3. Compile and install the SoFiA pipeline and user interface

   `python setup.py build --force`

   (add `--no-gui=True` to install SoFiA *without* graphical user interface)

4. Set up environment variables

    Follow the instructions given at the end of the installation process to 
    define the required environment variables and paths in your `.bashrc` or 
    `.cshrc` file.

5. Launch SoFiA

    Open a new terminal window and type:

    `SoFiA &`


Problems üö©
----------

If you encounter problems when running the setup script, it is likely 
that you are either missing one of the required packages and libraries or 
that some of the packages are outdated. Please check that the required 
versions of all packages are installed and properly set up such that they 
can be found by Python and the GCC. On some systems it may be necessary to 
explicitly install the GNU C++ compiler (g++, should normally be part of 
the GCC) as well as the development packages (dev) of Qt. Please also see 
the trouble shooting page on the SoFiA wiki for more information on a few 
commonly encountered problems:

Documentation üóÉÔ∏è
---------------

SoFiA comes with its own built-in help browser that can be launched from 
the help menu in the user interface. Alternatively, you can use your web 
browser to open the index.html file located in the gui/doc/ sub-folder.
